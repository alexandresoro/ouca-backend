# Où ça ? - Base Naturaliste

## About the project

The aim of the _Où ça ?_ project is to provide naturalists with an application where they can record and visualize their wildlife observations.

This project provides an API to interact with these observations - add new elements, edit them and so on.
This API is structured as a stateless microservice. It exposes a REST API and is agnostic of the integrator.

## Prerequisites

- _Node.js 22_ or later
- _pnpm 9_ or later
- PostgreSQL 17 or newer to store the data.
- A Redis instance used as temporary cache.
- An OIDC provider to provide authentication services.

Most of the app is independent of the OIDC provider as it follows standard claims except for roles that may be handled differently depending on the provider.
Hence, currently only [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/) is supported, but additional providers can be easily added.

## API structure

Application is exposed via a REST API available under `/v1/`. Specification is exposed at `/documentation`.

The application exposes a static path at `/download/:id`, that is to be used for downloading export files. The exact path is returned by the corresponding generate export endpoints.

## Authentication

The API require users to be authenticated.

Authentication is done using a separate OIDC provider.

On server side, a valid access token is expected in header `Authorization: Bearer xyzabc`.

The access token does not need to be a JWT token and can be an opaque one as introspection is performed server-side to validate the access token.

## Options

The following environment variables are available to configure the application:

## Structure of an observation

An observation is materialized by the following characteristics:

- An observer and potential associate observers.
- The observation date with an optional time and duration.
- A location for the observation. It is structured with a "locality" that belongs to a "town" which itself belongs to a "department".
- An optional temperature and weather characteristics.

The characteristics above are considered to be an inventory. An observation belongs to a single inventory, but an inventory can contain several observation, which represents a real use case where several observations can be made during the same session.

- A species and its related species class.
- An estimate on the number of species encountered.
- An estimate on the distance between the observer and the species observed.
- The age of the species encountered.
- The sex of the species encountered.
- An optional list of behaviors describing the state of the species.
- An optional list of environments surrounding the species.
- An optional comment on the observation.
